SLK is the only both LL(k) and LR(k) parser generator available.
The same syntax is used in both, so it is easy to switch
between top-down and bottom-up parsing based on need or
just preference.
SLK quickly does a full analysis of the
grammar. The SLK algorithm is the only known
solution to this NP-hard problem.
SLK can produce a customizable persistent parse tree
in addition to executing actions during parsing.
